## üíª Requirements
1. Nodejs 16 or higher: **[Link](https://nodejs.org)**
2. Git: **[Link](https://git-scm.com)**

## Getting Started
Before you start editing or forking this code you should have a basic knowledge of JavaScript and Discord.js v12. Having a basic knowledge will help you to not get a error by running or let's say you won't get confused. Basic Knowledge means you should know the basic functions and Syntax's.

## Create Discord Application
Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click "New Application" then name your application then click "Create". Now head over to Bot. Click Add Bot, then you customize the name and avatar(If youd like). Now lets get coding.

## Coding
Make a folder where you want to store all your bot files. Open CMD with that Folder location and type `npm init` This will create a `package.json` file in your directory.Then open Visual Studio Code with that Directory.then make a file with your main file name, in my case its `index.js`
